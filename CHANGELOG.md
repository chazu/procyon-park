## [Unreleased]

### Added
- `pp serve` now writes durable crash logs to `~/.pp/logs/crash-<epoch>.log`
  (plus a rolling append to `~/.pp/logs/pp-serve.log`) when the server
  exits abnormally. Previously a silent crash left no breadcrumb — operators
  had to infer the failure from `pp workflow status` returning
  "no response from server".
- `scripts/pp-supervisor.sh`: auto-restart wrapper for `pp serve` with a
  burst-window circuit breaker (`PP_SUPERVISOR_MAX_RESTARTS` per
  `PP_SUPERVISOR_BURST_WINDOW` seconds) and per-run + rolling log capture.

### Changed
- `Scheduler>>dispatchTask:` now wraps the entire post-dispatch sequence
  (harness run + scope validation + task-complete safety net + BBS status
  update + slot release) in a coarse exception handler. An uncaught fault
  in the forked goroutine previously could — and did — tear down the whole
  server process; it now degrades to an error log and a best-effort slot
  release.

### Fixed
- Strict input validation at every pp boundary (pp-input-validation-strict,
  umbrella for four child bugs):
  - `pp workitem run/show/update/comment` now require `--repo <scope>` (or
    `PP_SCOPE`); when omitted, the CLI errors pre-flight and lists the
    scopes where the identity actually lives. No more silent dispatch to
    the `default` scope.
  - `pp workitem update <id>` with no field flags is rejected as a no-op
    error instead of silently stamping `updated_at` and passing an empty
    payload through. The server-side handler is already PATCH-merge, so
    the client now refuses to send vacuous updates.
  - Workflow templates may declare `required: [...]`. `WorkflowEngine`
    validates required params are present and non-empty at instantiation
    and raises with the missing names — no more empty-prompt dispatch.
    `workflows/story.cue` and `workflows/story-lite.cue` now declare
    `description` as required.
  - `ClaudeHarness` refuses to spawn Claude when the task's rendered
    description is empty; sets `failureReason` so `WorkerAgent` marks
    the task failed with an actionable diagnostic ("run pp workitem
    update <id> --description ...") instead of letting the CLI exit 1
    and leaving the state machine to guess.
- `merge-worktree` on standalone story/story-lite/hotfix/spike workflows now
  fast-forwards the feature branch into `main` and pushes `origin/main`
  (best-effort) instead of leaving the commits stranded on `feature/<id>`.
  Previously the action emitted `merge-complete` without touching `main`,
  so work-items closed as "done" while nothing landed. The
  `merge-complete` observation now carries `merged_to_main: 'true' | 'false'`
  so downstream consumers can disambiguate.

### Changed
- `CreateWorktreeAction` records a `standalone` flag (and `parent_branch`
  when applicable) on the `worktree` signal so `MergeWorktreeAction` can
  distinguish wave-children (parent pipeline owns the main merge) from
  standalone workflows (self-managed main merge).
- Added `GitOps pushBranch:in:` helper.
