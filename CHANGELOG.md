## [Unreleased]

### Fixed
- `merge-worktree` on standalone story/story-lite/hotfix/spike workflows now
  fast-forwards the feature branch into `main` and pushes `origin/main`
  (best-effort) instead of leaving the commits stranded on `feature/<id>`.
  Previously the action emitted `merge-complete` without touching `main`,
  so work-items closed as "done" while nothing landed. The
  `merge-complete` observation now carries `merged_to_main: 'true' | 'false'`
  so downstream consumers can disambiguate.

### Changed
- `CreateWorktreeAction` records a `standalone` flag (and `parent_branch`
  when applicable) on the `worktree` signal so `MergeWorktreeAction` can
  distinguish wave-children (parent pipeline owns the main merge) from
  standalone workflows (self-managed main merge).
- Added `GitOps pushBranch:in:` helper.
